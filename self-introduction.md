Hello, everyone. I'm Tony, a software engineer. Very excited to join our team, in the past five years, I worked for Fidelity International and IBM. I hope I can help our team and grow with our team together in the future . That's all, thank you.

I'm Tony, my Chinese name is Litao. I'm thirty-three years old. I'm a front-end developer, I graduated from Dalian nationalities university in two thousand thirteen and got a master's degree. I'm good at javascript, especially react.

In the past five years, I worked for Fidelity and IBM and was continuously focusing on the frontend developments part. During the 5 years, I did several React projects such as smart-onboarding and Fidelity secure transaction site and  In IBM I did event-hub, agile metrics tools.

I'm the key member in those projects, not only coding as requirements, I also take part in building the frontend framework in Fidelity. In IBM I'm the frontend leader,  I built the framework by myself.

Before those react projects in Fidelity I did several public site using jQuery and NodeJS and also grunt gulp. For those projects, we were in a scrum team,  agile model, used JIRA to manage our project,  split our tasks to every sprint, we have many roles, such as PO, scrum master, UI designer, and front end backend developer. everyday morning we will have standup meeting, and Every sprint we also have planning meeting at the beginning and retrospect meeting at the end.

For my personal part, I'm married, and have a little daughter. In the spare time I love learning English and some new techniques through Google and YouTube, and also I love football, I like playing football and watching football games, I'm the fans of Real Madrid. I think that's all for me.

Reason why you want to find a new job:

A few days ago, our manager told us a bad news that all the business of our department will move to India , it seems we are facing to lose our job in a few months, so now I'm looking for a new opportunity to meet new challenges, but I think it's also a new chance for my future.

Reason why leave Fidelity

Leave Fidelity is a hard decision, At that time my line manager had resigned and a new leader came , he took his old friends into our team, I felt not comfortable about that. And another reason is that IBM used to be my dream company, because when I first graduated, the dormitory I lived in is very near from IBM building. So when I got the offer from IBM, I accepted it without any hesitation.

I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Would youÂ mind speaking more slowly?
